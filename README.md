This project is the result of our [Interactive getting started CLI tutorial](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/get-started/). The [Contentful CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/contentful-cli) helps you automating things like the creation of spaces and access tokens. We recommend using it to bootstrap this project.
